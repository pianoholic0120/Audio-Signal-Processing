## üìù Project Overview

This project performs a series of audio signal processing tasks using MATLAB, focusing on both time and frequency domain analyses. The tasks follow **eight key problems**, including FFT, STFT, filtering, resampling for pitch shifting, and quantization analysis.

## üìä Problem Breakdown

### **Problem 1 ‚Äì Time-Domain Plot**
- Extracted left channel (`y(:,1)`) of stereo signal.
- Time vector calculated using sample rate.
- Plotted waveform over entire 9s duration.
- Normalized amplitude to [-1, 1] for consistent viewing.

---

### **Problem 2 ‚Äì Sampling Rate Reduction**
- Original sample rate: **48,000 Hz**
- Tested downsampling by factors: **2, 4, 8** using `decimate`.
- Time-domain waveforms compared in fixed time range `[0.9, 0.92]`.
- Observation: lower sampling rates result in **loss of high-frequency details** and sparse waveform structures.

---

### **Problem 3 ‚Äì Quantization Analysis**
- Original signal assumed to be 16-bit.
- Simulated quantization at **16-bit, 8-bit, and 4-bit** precision.
- Observation: **Lower bit-depth introduces step-like distortion** and loss of fidelity, especially in 4-bit case.

---

### **Problem 4 ‚Äì FFT Spectrum**
- Used `fft()` to analyze frequency content.
- Observed energy mainly concentrated between **0‚Äì4kHz**, with minor components up to 12kHz.
- Frequencies beyond 12kHz show low amplitude (possible background or recording noise).
- Plotted both full and half-spectrum (Nyquist limit).

---

### **Problem 5 ‚Äì Zero Padding**
- Applied zero-padding to double time-domain length.
- Compared original vs. zero-padded FFT results.
- Found **interpolation of spectrum improves visual frequency resolution**, but **true resolution unchanged**.

---

### **Problem 6 ‚Äì STFT / Spectrogram**
- Window length: **1024 samples** ‚Üí ‚âà 21.3ms time window.
- Compared 4 configurations:
  - Hamming + 50% overlap
  - Hamming + 75% overlap
  - Hann + 50% overlap
  - Hann + 75% overlap
- Frequency resolution: **‚âà 46.9 Hz**
- Time resolution (hop size):  
  - 50% ‚Üí **10.7 ms**  
  - 75% ‚Üí **5.3 ms**
- Trade-off observed between **time resolution** and **frequency clarity**.

---

### **Problem 7 ‚Äì Noise Filtering**
- Designed a **6th-order Butterworth low-pass filter** with cutoff = 6kHz.
- Used `filtfilt()` for zero-phase filtering.
- Compared filtered vs. original in both time and frequency domains.
- Observed reduced high-frequency noise in frequency plot; audible difference was minor due to already clean recording.

---

### **Problem 8 ‚Äì Pitch Shifting (Optional)**
- Used `resample(y, p, q)` to alter pitch:
  - `p=4, q=5` ‚Üí **pitch up (0.8√ó slower signal)**
  - `p=5, q=4` ‚Üí **pitch down (1.25√ó faster signal)**
- Played audio with original `Fs`, resulting in perceived **pitch shift and time speed change**.
- Mentioned that **independent pitch/time control** requires more advanced methods (e.g., phase vocoder).

## ‚ñ∂Ô∏è How to Run
1. Open `Project.m` in MATLAB.
2. Ensure audio file `Project.m4a` is in the same folder.
3. Uncomment each problem section one at a time to visualize and play results.
4. Use `sound()` to listen to original, filtered, or pitch-shifted versions.
